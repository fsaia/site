Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in mathematics at the [University of Georgia](https://www.math.uga.edu/) in Athens, GA. My advisor is [Pete L. Clark](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pete/). I completed my B.S. in math and physics at [Tufts University](https://math.tufts.edu/) in Medford, MA in 2017.  


I am on the **job market** in the 2022-2023 academic year! See the research, teaching, and service tabs above for relevant information, as well as my CV linked below.  

I will be attending the **2023 Joint Mathematics Meetings** in Boston, MA, and [will be speaking](https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2023/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/18238) on Wednesday, 1/4 at 8:30 a.m. in the AMS Special Session on Arithmetic Geometry Informed by Computation.
