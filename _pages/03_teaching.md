In Fall 2024 I am teaching Math 180: Calculus.  

Fall 2024 Office Hours: MW 12-1 p.m. in [MSLC](https://mslc.uic.edu/), or by appointment.  


As a graduate student at UGA, I completed the UGA Pride center's [Safe Space Training](https://lgbtcenter.uga.edu/content_page/safe-space). I consider my office a safe space for all, and I hope that you do, too! I also completed UGA's [Certificate in Diversity and Inclusion](http://diversity.uga.edu/index.php/programs/article/cdi).
