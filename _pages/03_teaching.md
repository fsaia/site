In Spring 2023 I am teaching Math 1113: Precalculus. Our class will utilize a flipped classroom structure emphasizing active, collaborative problem solving and learning.  


Office hours for Spring 2023 are

* to be determined!  


I have undergone the UGA Pride center's [Safe Space Training](https://lgbtcenter.uga.edu/content_page/safe-space) and consider my office a safe space for all. I hope that you do, too! I have also completed the university's [Certificate in Diversity and Inclusion](http://diversity.uga.edu/index.php/programs/article/cdi).
