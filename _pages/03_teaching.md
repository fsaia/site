In Spring 2025 I am teaching Math 210: Multivariable Calculus and [Math 525: Elliptic Curves](https://fsaia.github.io/site/math_525/).  

Spring 2025 Office Hours: MW 12:30-1:30 p.m. in SEO 610, or by appointment.  


As a graduate student at UGA, I completed the UGA Pride center's [Safe Space Training](https://lgbtcenter.uga.edu/content_page/safe-space). I consider my office a safe space for all, and I hope that you do, too! I also completed UGA's [Certificate in Diversity and Inclusion](http://diversity.uga.edu/index.php/programs/article/cdi).
