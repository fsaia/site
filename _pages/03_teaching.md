In Fall 2019 I am teaching Math 2250, Calculus I for Science and Engineering, CRN 15611.  

Office hours for Fall 2019 are

* Mondays, Wednesdays 1:30-2:30 p.m.  
* Thursdays, 9:30-10:30 a.m.

or by appointment.  

I have undergone the LGBT center's [safe space training](https://lgbtcenter.uga.edu/content_page/safe-space) and consider my office a safe space for all. I hope that you do, too! I am in the process of completing the university's [Certificate in Diversity and Inclusion](http://diversity.uga.edu/index.php/programs/article/cdi).
